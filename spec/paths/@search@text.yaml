  summary: Search sounds
  description: >-
    This resource allows searching sounds in Freesound by matching their
    tags and other kinds of metadata.
  operationId: searchText
  produces:
    - application/xml
    - application/json
  parameters:
    - name: query
      in: query
      description: >-
        The query! The query is the main parameter used to define a query.
        You can type several terms separated by spaces or phrases wrapped
        inside quote ‘”’ characters. For every term, you can also use ‘+’
        and ‘-‘ modifier characters to indicate that a term is “mandatory”
        or “prohibited” (by default, terms are considered to be
        “mandatory”). For example, in a query such as query=term_a -term_b,
        sounds including term_b will not match the search criteria. The
        query does a weighted search over some sound properties including
        sound tags, the sound name, its description, pack name and the sound
        id. Therefore, searching for query=123 will find you sounds with id
        1234, sounds that have 1234 in the description, in the tags, etc.
        You’ll find some examples below. Using an empty query (query= or
        query="") will return all Freeosund sounds.

      description: >-
        This parameter represents a boolean option to indicate whether to
        collapse results belonging to sounds of the same pack into single
        entries in the results list. If `group_by_pack=1` and search results
        contain more than one sound that belongs to the same pack, only one
        sound for each distinct pack is returned (sounds with no packs are
        returned as well). However, the returned sound will feature two
        extra properties to access these other sounds omitted from the
        results list: `n_from_same_pack`: indicates how many other results
        belong to the same pack (and have not been returned)
        `more_from_same_pack`: uri pointing to the list of omitted sound
        results of the same pack (also including the result which has
        already been returned). See examples below. By default
        `group_by_pack=0`.

        with bigger `page_size`, more data will need to be transferred.
